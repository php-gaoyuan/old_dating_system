	var $gf_con5="It is the traditional culture in China that giving gifts by a man to his Lady is crucial evidence of love and affection. A Chinese woman “takes care of her man” – she keeps the house, looks out for his health, feeds him (literally), raises his children, looks after his family, caters to his every whim, gives him her body, and frequently tolerates his bad moods and ill manners. In return he reciprocates with the frequent giving of gifts. We do not suggest that you buy a gift for every Chinese girl you encounter while communicate online, but when you have settled on one special Chinese lady as being really important to you, a gift will go a long way to make her believe she is truly special in your eyes. To a Western Man the need to give gifts may seem to commercialize the relationship, which in his mind is supposed to be about “love”, not “material things”. But she is not a Westerner, and to her, the failure to give a gift is a sign that you do not care and do not appreciate all that she does for you (or hopes to do for you when you can come together). The act of giving a gift demonstrates that you are open to her culture, that you care and that you have a good heart. In an international or cross-cultural relationship such a gesture can be the glue that cements your developing bonds. lovelove.com currently can deliver flowers and gifts to any address in Mainland China. Your potential partner will appreciate both your gift and the special attention she is receiving from you.";

Receiving a gift from someone who is many miles away and is sorely missed tells them that they are missed too. Receiving a gift brings almost as wonderful feeling to one’s heart as giving a gift does. Why not tell someone you love them today.";
